Concepts covered :
*Passwordless authentication,Anible inventory and Anible ad-hoc commands.

Passwordless Authentication:
It will help ansible control node to communicate with the managed nodes without requiring a password input each time to do automation.
copy the control node private key to the managed node and past it in the .ssh folder authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh 

In etc sshd-config need to update the file
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PasswordAuthentication no

Ansible Inventory:
Ansible inventory is a file that lists the computers and groups of computers that ansible will manage.
we have to save this file using .yaml extension.
The inventory file contains the names and IP addresses of the managed nodes.
default ansible inventory file location will be "/etc/ansible/hosts".
grouping the servers in the inventory file enables better control over which servers receive specific commands

Anible ad-hoc commands:
Ad-hoc commands are a simple way to provide instructions to Ansible on the control node.
Ad hoc commands are useful for simple tasks that can be done with one simple command such as testing connections with instances or listing files in a directory.
