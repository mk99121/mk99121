the scheduler is responsible for assigning pods to nodes in the cluster based on various criteria.Sometimes you might encounter situations where pods are not being scheduled as expected.
this is because of node constraints,pod requirements,cluster configurations.

1.Node Selector:
Node Selector is a simple way to spread pods to nodes with specific labels. 
It allows you to specify a set of key-value pairs that will match the nodes labels for a pod to be scheduled on that node.

Ex:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  nodeSelector:
    type: backend
