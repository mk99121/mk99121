Node Affinity:

Node Affinity is a more imp way to allows you to specify rules about which nodes your pod is eligible to be scheduled on based on the labels of those nodes
It allows you to specify rules that apply only if certain conditions are met. 

Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - "us-east-1"

Here,kubernetes will ensure that the pod is only scheduled on nodes labeled with zone: us-east-1
