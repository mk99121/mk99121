Taint:
Taints are applied to nodes to repel certain pods. They allow nodes to refuse pods unless the pods have a matching toleration.
taints are used to prevent certain types of workloads from running on specific nodes
Use kubectl taint command to apply taints to nodes.include tolerations field in the pod's YAML definition to tolerate specific taints.

kubectl taint nodes node-1 app=non-critical:NoSchedule


Tolerations:
Tolerations are applied to pods and allow them to schedule onto nodes with matching taints. They override the effect of taints.

Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: app
    operator: Equal
    value: non-critical
    effect: NoSchedule

Kubernetes will schedule my-pod onto nodes even if they have the taint app=non-critical:NoSchedule.
If the pod didt have a toleration matching the taint it would not be scheduled onto nodes with that taint and it will remain in a pending state.
