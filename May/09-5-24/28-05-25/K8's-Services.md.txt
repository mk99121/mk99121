Importance of Services in Kubernetes:

Services are very imp component of Kubernetes in production scenarios.
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction of pods and it exposes the application into the internet and It enables communication between different parts of your application
accessing services using the service name instead of the IP addresses because The IP's keep on changes.
TYPES OF SERVICES:
Cluster IP: the application can only be accessed within the Kubernetes cluster.he service provides discovery and load balancing within the cluster.

Node Port:Node port mode allows the application to be accessed within the organization.Users within the organization who have access to the worker node IP addresses can access the application.

Load Balancer:Load balancer mode exposes the application to the external world.It provides a public IP address, such as an elastic load balancer IP address on a cloud provider, allowing anyone with internet access to reach the application.
This type is suitable for applications that need to be accessible globally

Challenges with Load Balancing:
the load balancing mechanism provided by services which only offer simple round-robin load balancing.
the cost of using static public IP addresses for load balancing is expensive.
each load balancer exposes single service to the internet.
