CrashLoopBackOff:

it means that kubelet is trying to run the container but it keeps failing and crashing. After crashing kubernetes tries to restart the container automatically
but if the container keeps failing repeatedly you end up in a loop of crashes and restarts. this is called CrashLoopBackOff.

Common Situations of CrashLoopBackOff:

1.Misconfigurations:
Misconfigurations can causes issues from incorrect environment variables to improper setup of service ports or volumes.
These misconfigurations can prevent the application from starting correctly, leading to crashes.
For example, if an application expects a certain environment variable to connect to a database and that variable is not set or is incorrect
the application might crash as it cannot establish a database connection.

2.Errors in the Liveness Probes:
Liveness probes in Kubernetes are used to check the health of a container. If a liveness probe is incorrectly configured
it might falsely report that the container is unhealthy, causing Kubernetes to kill and restart the container repeatedly. 
For example if the liveness probe checks a URL or port that the application does not expose or checks too soon before the application is ready
the container will be repeatedly terminated and restarted.

3.The Memory Limits Are Too Low:
If the memory limits set for a container are too low the application might exceed this limit especially under load leading to the container being killed by Kubernetes.
This can happen repeatedly if the workload does not decrease causing a cycle of crashing and restarting. 
Kubernetes uses these limits to ensure that containers do not consume all available resources on a node which can affect other containers.

4.Wrong Command Line Arguments:
Containers might be configured to start with specific command-line arguments. If these arguments are wrong or lead to the application exiting 
for example passing an invalid option to a commannd the container will exit immediately.
An example would be configuration file path that does not exist
