StatefulSets:
StatefulSets are like deployments but it is used for deploying statefull applications where pods need the database to work on..
Each Pod can associated with its own Persistent volume and the data is retained even if the Pod is deleted.
In statefullsets pods are created in sequence order like once the first pod created and running then the second pod will create..
even same for updates and deletion of the pods, one pod at a time.
 example:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  minReadySeconds: 10
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 10
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: registry.k8s.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
        volumeMounts:
        - name: www
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: ebs
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
