Storage class:

1. A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer.
2. Here we are offering EBS Storage for EKS Cluster
EX:

apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata: 
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer 

Persistant Volume Claim:


1.Dynamic volume provisioning allows storage volumes to be created on-demand.
2.Without dynamic provisioning cluster administrators have to manually make calls to their cloud or storage provider to create new storage volumes,
and then create PersistentVolume objects to represent them in k8s 
3. The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for cluster administrators to pre-provision storage. 
Instead it automatically provisions storage when it is requested by users.
PVC:Users request dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class in their PersistentVolumeClaim
Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-mysql-pv-claim
spec: 
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
  resources: 
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
	  
	  
CONFIG MAP
1. ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. 
2. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables,command-line arguments or as configuration files in a volume.
Eample:

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: usermanagement-dbcreation-script
data: 
  mysql_usermgmt.sql: |-
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS webappdb;
    CREATE DATABASE webappdb;
